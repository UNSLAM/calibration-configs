## Camera calibration Config Files

This repository contains config.yaml files with paremeters associated to each device.

To keep things simple, each folder identifies a device, and inside it there's a config.yaml for that device.

The results shown here were generated with the [camera calibration tool](https://github.com/UNSLAM/camera-calibration).
